# Wireframes  

## These wireframes helped me get started and are unlikekly to be updated.  Don't expect them to be current.  

The pictures need no explanation.  wireframe-raw-data.xml is a saved copy of the data: go to [https://www.draw.io/]() to edit them (but, again, this is optional as they are assumed to be not current).
