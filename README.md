I'm interested in personal finance and wanted a tool to help me show my web development skills in a way that's interesting to me.  

This site attempts to be accurate, but **I cannot guarantee that it is accurate**.  

**Do not make financial decisions based on this site.**  

## Business Problem Solved  
Save time and effort on checking important but time-consuming tasks.  It's important to maintain a portfolio composition / asset allocation that matches your risk profile, but it takes time to run all of the calculations.  This site does the calculations so you can spend more time thinking strategically.  

Convey information in a dashboard with graphics.

## Technologies Used
* Vue.js  
* JavaScript / HTML / SCSS  

## Libraries & Plugins
* Chart.js to show the data in a chart  
* Twitter Bootstrap  

## Future Implementations  
* Add a page where the user can do what-if analysis so that they can quicky compare the impact of different trades.  

## Known issues  
* The file name for 'App.vue' is capitalized and the other .vue files are all lowercase.  I encountered a bug where the project wouldn't load consistently if I followed the all-lowercase naming convention on that file.  I'll submit an issue on this when I have the time.
