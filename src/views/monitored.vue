    <h1>Monitored securities</h1>
    <p>
      Some securities are riskier than others.   In a future implementation of the site you can 
      tag a security as needing monitoring and set thresholds for it.  This page will (eventually) 
      show you where the value of the stock is compared to those thresholds.
