      I'm interested in personal finance and wanted a tool to help me show my web 
      development skills in a way that's interesting to me.

    <h2>How numbers are rounded on this site</h2>
    <p>
      Because the objective of the site is to provide a big-picture overview of your asset allocation,
      certain numbers are rounded so that you don't get lost in the minutae.
    </p>
    <p class="d-none d-md-block">
      The "Value" column is rounded to the nearest dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "% of Portfolio" column and graph are rounded to the nearest 1/10 of 1%.  As such, percentages may
      add to slightly higher or lower than 100%.
